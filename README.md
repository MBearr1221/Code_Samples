# Code_Samples
A selection of code samples intended for employment seekers.

Code selections include a color/number mapping function which is used in many of my smaller programs, as well as the custom image viewing script I use on mywebsite.

HTML, JavaScript and CSS for my website can all be viewed by pressing F12 on a computer while the website is loaded and viewing the debugger.

The website address is provided on my resume.
